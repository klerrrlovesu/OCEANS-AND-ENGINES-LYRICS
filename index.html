Saturday sunset
<br>
We're lying on my bed with five hours to go
<br>
Fingers entwined and so were our minds
<br>
Cryin', "I don't want you to go"
<br>
You wiped away your tears
<br>
But not fears under the still and clear indigo
<br>
You said, "Baby, don't cry, we'll be fine
<br>
You're the one thing I swear I can't outgrow"<div>
    <br>
</div>

My mother said the younger me was a pretending prodigy
<br>
Well, nothing then, much has changed
<br>
'Cause while you're wolfin' down liquor
<br>
My soul, it gets sicker
<br>
But I'm stickin' to the screenplay
<br>
Gotta say I'm okay, but answer this, babe<div>
    <br>
</div>

How is it now that somehow you're a strangеr?
<br>
You were mine just yеsterday
<br>
I pray the block in my airway dissipates
<br>
And instead deters your airplane's way
<br>
But heaven denied
<br>
Destiny decried
<br>
Something beautiful died
<br>
Too soon<div>
    <br>

</div>

But I'm letting go
<br>
I'm givin' up the ghost
<br>
But don't get me wrong
<br>
I'll always love you, that's why
<br>
I wrote you this very last song<div>
    <br>

</div>

I guess this is where we say goodbye
<br>
I know I'll be alright
<br>
Someday I'll be fine
<br>
But just not tonight (ooh)<div>
    <br>

</div>

Plungin' into all kinds of diversions
<br>
Like blush wine and sonorous soirées
<br>
But even with gin and surgin' adrenaline
<br>
I see you're all that can intoxicate <div>
    <br>

</div>
Oceans and engines
<br>
You're skilled at infringin' on great love affairs
<br>
'Cause now my heart's home
<br>
All I've known is long gone and ten thousand miles away
<br>
And I'm not okay<div>
<br>
</div>

But I'm letting go
<br>
I'm giving up the ghost
<br>
But don't get me wrong
<br>
I'll always love you, that's why
<br>
I wrote you this very last song
<br>
I guess this is where we say goodbye
<br>
I know I'll be alright<div>
    <br>
</div>

But just not
<br>
Tonight was the first time I stared into seas
<br>
Of beguiling sepia two years ago
<br>
And the first time I learned real world superpowers lived in three words
<br>
They revitalize my fraying bones, oh
<br>
Now what do you do when your pillar crumbled down
<br>
You've lost all solid ground
<br>
Both dreams and demons drowned
<br>
And this void's all you've found
<br>
And doubts light it aglow?<div>
    <br>

</div>

I have so many questions
<br>
But I'm pouring them into the ocean
<br>
And I'm starting up my engine<div>
    <br>

</div>

And I'm letting go
<br>
I'm givin' up your ghost
<br>
It's come to a close
<br>
I marked the end with this last song I wrote
<br>
I'm letting go
<br>
This is the last falsetto
<br>
I'll ever sing to you
<br>
My great lost love
